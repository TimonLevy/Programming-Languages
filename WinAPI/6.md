#### א. What does the function `GetLastError()` return?

The function return the current thread's (The thread the function was run on) last error code. Some functions set error codes that can allow developers to debug their code easier by knowing what was the error.

Some functions set the error code to 0 if they succeed and some functions don't set error cods when they run, in that case the function will retrieve the last known error code.

Error codes are an `unsigned int`.


#### ב. How to use it and when?

When calling the function it returns an `unsigned int` that represents the error, you can call this function when using a function that uses `SetErrorCode()` to help debug your code. As to deciphering the error codes, you can either search them online or use lookup functions that retrieve a string that describes the error, like `FormatMessage()`. 


#### ג. I used the function and I got the value "1707", What does it mean?

| CODE      | REASON                            |
| --        | --                                |
| 1707      | The network address is invalid.   |

This error code means that a network address used in the code is invalid.


#### ד. Integrate the function in the code of question 5.

Done :)


#### ה. Repair the command `net helpmsg 119`

The command works?
