# WinAPI

### 1.

#### א. What is WinApi?

The WinAPI is a collection of basic windows functions made accessible for C programming. WinAPI allows a programmer to work with files, data streams, processes, GUI, windows networking and more.
 
#### ב. What is MSDN?

MSDN (MicroSoft Developer network) is a microsoft platform and information center for development on microsoft platform and OS, sample code, libraries and technical support.

#### ג. Unicode VS. ASCII, and how does it come to light in C?

Both Unicode and Ascii exist to perform the same function, and that is easily standadize the way special characters are kept. And that was it to use character encoding, encoding a character simply means giving it a number that represents it. ASCII came before Unicode, and it can encode 128 english and special characters. Unicode does the exact same thing, however it exists to serve as a standard for every character there is using more than 1 byte, as the amount of charcater grew Unicode dedicated more bytes to represent each letter (UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 or 1 byte, 2 bytes and 4 bytes). Infact the first 128 characters in Unicode are the ASCII ones, meaning that ASCII is a subset of Unicode.

Out of the box C only supports 8 bit characters, that means you can only print ASCII characters. so in order to print 32 and 64 bit character the is a need to use special encoding and functions explained [here](https://linuxhint.com/unicode-c/#:~:text=Unicode%20in%20C%201%20Syntax:%20To%20print%20a,We%20discussed%20about%20unicoding%20in%20this%20article.%20).

#### ד. The meaning of `typedef` in C
The C language provides a keyword called `typedef` wich can be use to give existing native/custom structs new names. 

Like, instead of using a fully `struct` name to declare a new `struct` variable:
```
struct newStruct{
int someInfo;
char* moreInfo;
float anothermember;
};

struct newStruct thisnewStruct = ...;
```

We can use:
```
typedef struct newStruct{
int someInfo;
char* moreInfo;
float anothermember;
} newStructName;

newStructName thisnewStruct = ...;
```

#### ה. What is the `windoes.h` header?
The `windows.h` header contains the most used [data structures], [functions] and [headers] from the Win32 API, this in turn makes it way easier to include all the functions and structs you need from the WinAPI to your program!!
