# The Difference: 'C++' VS. 'C'
'**C**' and '**C++**' are both low level programming languages however different. do what are those differences?

||C|C++|
|--|--|--|
|1. __Programming Style__| Is a procedural programming language. Allowing for construction of blocks of instructions to manipulate data, those blocks can include local data. And all of those make up the program. | Is a object-Oriented programming language (OOP). C++ keeps it's data in an encapsulated abstract structure, that structure can contain it's own behavior (methods) and identifiers. The program heavily depends on those structures. |
|2. __Features__| Provides 32 keywords & built-in data types. | Provides 63 keywords, encapsulation & inheritance , function and operator overrides (polymorphism), access modifiers, exception handling, reference variables.  |
|3. __Memory management__| Manual memory allocation to structs & Garbage collector. | Manual memory allocation to structs & NO Garbage collector. |

In essence C is almost a subset of C++, meaning C++ almost contains C inside of it. This also means that almost any C code will be able to compile in a  C++ compiler with little to no change.
